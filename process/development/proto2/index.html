        <p>This project focuses on the combination of and relationship between audio and visuals. The combination of the two create synaesthesia, the stimulation of senses. Some users are able to see sound in shapes and color, and I hope that this project allows them to explore the two senses through browser-based interaction. Those who produce music, enjoy listening to music, and are interested in visuals/graphics are the target audience. This project encourages creativity, appeals
        to synaesthesia, and also provides a way for artists to visualize their audio.</p>

        <p>The goal is to allow users to create their own visuals based on their own unique audio recording, influenced by the concept of synaesthesia. Audio wil be presented by a waveform and other shapes on-screen. When creating audio, the pitch and speed could be customized. Users can choose what shapes and colors they would like to use, and when finished creating, they can share their creations online with other users.</p>
