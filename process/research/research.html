      Most of us may experience stress, anxiety, and depression sometime in our lives. These emotions can range from light or mild to heavy and severe, and can stem from everyday experiences such as work and relationships. They can even come from conditions of the environment or surroundings. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, 1 in 5 Americans have a diagnosable mental disorder.
There are many ways to treat these disorders, especially ways that donâ€™t require prescription drugs or medications, for example, therapy. This form of treatment is evolving with the rise of virtual reality technology.
