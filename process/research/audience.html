        <h2>Shaun C.</h2>
        <img src="../../images/persona3.jpg" width="540" height="360" alt="young man with earbuds and backpack" title="Photo by Yingchou Han on Unsplash">
        <p>
        Age: 24 <br>
        Occupations: Music producer, Sales associate at local record shop <br>
        Location: Sacramento<br>
        <br>
        Shaun is an up-and-coming music artist. He has a fair amount of followers on social media platforms: for example, SoundCloud, where he posts his music. Shaun recently released an EP on BandCamp, and is looking for more ways to make a name for himself in the music industry.<br>
        <br>
        Although he's only been posting songs for people to listen to, Shaun has considered incorporating video elements into his work so that his fans could enjoy some visuals along with his music. He has thought about creating music videos for his songs, and even performing live sets that would require background visuals â€” but he lacks skills in the field of visual art, and doesn't know where to start. <br>
